# EODP Assignment 2 README
Overview
These are a series of Python scripts for analyzing the relationship between socio-economic factors and crime rates, particularly focusing on how these relationships can be utilized to predict offence counts in various suburbs. The analysis includes data imputation, visualizations through scatter plots and linear regression as well as correlation heatmaps. It also includes code for the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression models for classification.

Contents
Data Imputation: Code for handling missing values in the dataset, ensuring data integrity and enabling effective analysis.

Scatter Plots: Visual representations of the relationships between socio-economic factors (such as unemployment rates and low-income household proportions) and crime rates alongside fitted linear regression lines.

Correlation Heatmaps: Heatmaps generated to visualize the Pearson correlation coefficients between variables, aiding in identifying significant relationships and patterns in the data.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Implementation of the KNN algorithm for predicting whether a suburb has a high or low offence count based on the socio-economic variables.

Logistic Regression: Implementation of a logistic regression model for binary classification, providing an alternative method for predicting offence counts based on socio-economic factors.

Requirements
